My project had several hiccups regarding different frameworks i had tried out. For one, I could not get NumPy installed, and ASCIIMATICS proved to be too poorly documented to figure out in the time frame given. Otherwise, I focused on the ChatGPT api, and fleshed out a simple GPT powered terminal bot.
I was proud of my ability to quickly flesh it out a relatively well considering.
